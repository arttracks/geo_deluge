# GeoDeluge

This gem is designed to abstract away querying various gazetters for data in a Linked Data environment.  It's still **very** alpha, but at this point will query for data against the Who's on First project from Mapzen.

This is part of the Art Tracks project from the Carnegie Museum of Art in Pittsburgh, PA, and the research has been supported by a grant from the Samuel H. Kress Foundation.

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'geo_deluge'
